**Chemist II @ PL Developments (_May 2020 - April 2024_)**
-	Investigated, created, collaborated with other chemists for the development of new test methods for the improvement of Antihistamine Active Ingredients
-	Performed testing and wrote protocols to support method verifications, method validations, method transfers, and process validations.
-	Cleaned, organized, and created graphs and charts to display and communicate findings of the data obtained from the developments of the news methods.

-	Reviewed and revised SOP’s to reflect current laboratory practices and test methods.
-	Tested packaging components, labels, raw materials, finished product, and stability samples.
-	Reviewed documentation to assure accuracy for Release/Reject decisions.


### Projects
-	Project 1:  utilized ggplot2 for data visualization, tidy verse for data manipulation, and conducted correlation, such as linear, multiple, and logistic regression for data on preventative health practices and risk behaviors that are linked to chronic disease, injuries, in adult populations. Outcome: utilized R to clean and filter data to understand the characteristics of those who had strokes or diabetes and whether they received help or did preventative health practices.
-	Project 2: Created multiple linear regression analysis in R by partitioning data in a training and validation set to help determine which variables were significantly important to the regression model. Outcome: able to predict new cardholders’ credit card balances based on variables that held significance.
-	Project 3:  used k-means and hierarchical cluster analysis in R to compare the outcomes from a dataset that consisted of a company’s employees. Outcome: Provided valuable insights to develop strategies to address job satisfaction needs of a company’s employees based on their characteristics and performance.
